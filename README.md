# Game Overview

## Introduction

"Mission Impossible: MHAZM" is a 3D Isometric stealth-action game with puzzle-solving elements. It has a total of six levels with increasing difficulty levels. In each level, we have an open design map, in which the player can move freely. Main goal of the player is to dodge the patrolling guards and collect the loot and drop them to a safe zone. The main goal is the outsmart guards, solve maze-like rooms, loot valuables, and upgrade your skills without getting caught.

Key aspects such as the main character (the thief), the core gameplay loop (Action, Rewards, Progression), and the overall story of a burglar escalating from petty theft to breaking into highly secured places were maintained. The unique selling point of delivering a lightweight game incorporating mechanics from AAA stealth titles was a guiding principle throughout development.
Minor iterative refinements were made during the development cycle, primarily in level design to enhance player experience and puzzle complexity. Power-up mechanics were fine-tuned based on internal testing to ensure balanced gameplay. The number of levels is set to six, focusing on quality and replayability, with a framework for future expansion.

### Genre

Our game falls under the stealth and action genre. It focuses on sneaky gameplay where the player avoids guards, solves puzzles, and collects loot without getting caught. While there’s some action involved.

### Target Audience

Our main target audience is core gamers, especially those between the ages of 18 to 35. These are players who enjoy thinking through challenges. The game is perfect for people who love stealth, strategy, and solving tricky puzzles in intense, sneaky situations.
